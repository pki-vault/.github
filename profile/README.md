# PKI Vault (Coming Soon)
Welcome to the future home of **PKI Vault** - a next-generation microservice for safe and easy storage of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
certificates and private keys. Our mission is to simplify the management and usage of PKI certificates by providing a powerful yet easy-to-use solution for
developers, DevOps engineers and enterprises alike.

## Planned Core Features
* Storage of PKI certificates and their metadata and chain relationships
* Import of certificates (Bulk, ACME generated)
* Certificate subscriptions for specific attributes: Clients (e.g. other services relying on certificates) can subscribe to certificates based on specific characteristics and fetch the latest available version
* Intuitive and easy-to-use APIs
* Automatic generation of OpenAPI clients for seamless API integration
* Support for multiple storage backends to suit your specific needs

## Potential Enterprise Features (Once core features are implemented)
These are some of the aspirational targets we aim to achieve for our enterprise offering.
Please note that the actual implementation and availability of these features may vary as we continue to develop and refine our product:

* Management Frontend
* Alerts on expiring certificate subscriptions (no available certificate satisfying subscription)
* Event publishing integration with popular messaging services like Kafka
* Client side private key encryption
* Advanced analytics and reporting
* Audit Logging
* Comprehensive access control
* Integration with popular Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions
* High-Availability SaaS offering with guaranteed SLAs
* Dedicated support

## Project Timeline
We are hard at work developing PKI Vault, and while we don't have a specific release date just yet, we're committed to delivering a high-quality solution that meets the needs of developers, DevOps engineers and enterprises alike. Stay tuned for more information and updates!

## Contributing
Once the core project is launched, we will welcome contributions from the community.
